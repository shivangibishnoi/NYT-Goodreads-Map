# NYT-Goodreads-Map

We will make a map showing the New York Times Bestselling authors for the "Combined Print & E-Book" category since its inception in February 2011. The final map also shows how the authors' NYT bestsellers have fared on Goodreads as their average ratings across their NYT bestsellers (if there are multiple).

It works in the following order:

1. ```nyt-bestseller-scrape.ipynb``` scrapes the NYT bestseller titles along with names of authors, book description, ranking, and how many weeks the book has been on the list.
2. ```scraping-goodreads-books.ipynb``` scrapes these books and author links from goodreads along with the rating of the book and the number of readers who reviewed the book.
3. ```scraping-goodreads-authors.ipynb``` goes to the author URLs we scraped in the previous version and gets the authors' place of birth
4. ```geolocating_authors.ipynb``` uses the Google Maps API to find the cooridnates of the authors' birthplaces to build our map
5. ```data_cleaning.ipnyb``` cleans the text of the columns
6. ```mapbox-data-prep.ipynb``` aggregates the data and prepares it for the map
7. The subfolder ```Maps Stuff``` contains the final data files and html to create the map
